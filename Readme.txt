Read Me for BreakOut Game

BreakOut game in Java is developed with the intent of -

Understand how to pause, resume and restart a game.
How to add a Fps in a game
Add Score in the game
Get time elapsed for a particular game (Not sure about its probable usage, but in this game it can be to increase ball speed with passage of time @ToDo)


These have been implemented, apart from using time to increase the speed of the ball, as right now the speed is same and game as such is not challenging, or fun, but it did it's job of making the programmer familiar with OOP's concept :D
